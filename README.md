## What is this?

Here I store my learning record of the online course "Machine learning" provided by Andrew NG on 
Coursera.

## Why am I learning machine learning?

For the time being, as a mechanical engineer, it's probably OK to know nothing about AI and machine 
learning. However, since the AI industry is booming incredibly fast and starting to penetrate into 
about every area of our life, it's reasonably likely that we will get to learn AI in the near future 
not necessarily as an engineer but as a sound educated human.
